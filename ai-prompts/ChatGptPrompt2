imagine you are a test automation engineer. Read the User Story and Acceptance Criteria below. Your task is to create clear and practical test scenarios for the Auto Loan / Quick Auto Loan calculator. For each test scenario, include: Scenario name , description Preconditions , setup Steps to perform ,Expected result.
User Story
As a user, I want to calculate the monthly payment amount for Auto Loan / Quick Auto Loan based on my income or loan amount (including all necessary payments) and request a loan, so that I can make an informed decision. 
Context 
On https://tbcbank.ge/ka/loans/auto-loan/auto-installment and https://tbcbank.ge/ka/loans/auto-loan/quick-auto-installment pages, the calculator currently does not include additional fees necessary for an exact monthly payment and calculates only by percentage.
There are also no CRM processes for these products; users cannot request a call from the website to be contacted by a bank representative.

Acceptance Criteria (Summary)
• Calculator logic must match https://tbccredit.ge/ for GEL.
• Support two modes: Based on Income and Based on Loan Amount.
• Include additional fees in effective monthly payment, not only base percentage.
Calculator Logic
 General formula reference (financial): PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type]) where:
 - rate: annual interest averaged per 12 months
 - nper: period in months
 - pmt: monthly payment (derived from income-based rules or loan-based amortization)
 Note: Effective interest rate (with fees) must be displayed alongside base interest rate.
Mode A — Based on Income (შემოსავლით)
  Income entered in GEL (tooltip required).
  Loan currency selectable: GEL / USD / EUR (admin-configurable in CMS).
  Period range (months) configurable in CMS: Auto Installment 6–120; Quick Auto Loan 6–72.
  Monthly contribution (ყოველთიური შენატანი) = portion of income based on thresholds:
   • If income < 1500: GEL→25% of income; USD/EUR→20% of income.
   • If income ≥ 1500: GEL→50% of income; USD/EUR→30% of income.
   Loan limit is calculated (consult TBCCredit team for the exact formula).
   Display: Base interest (e.g., From 14.5%) and Effective interest (e.g., From 26.13%) – both editable via CMS.
Mode B — Based on Loan Amount (სესხის თანხით)
  Loan amount in GEL/USD/EUR (min 200 ₾, max 80,000 ₾).
  If outside range, auto-correct to min/max.
  Monthly payment must include both principal and interest (standard amortization).
  Currency default GEL; currency list configurable from CMS; tooltip clarifies behavior.
  Period range configurable in CMS (see Mode A).
  Display base and effective rates (CMS).
 What to Test (Recommended Scenarios)
  • UI: Field presence, tooltips
  • Income mode: threshold logic for monthly contribution across currencies; edge incomes (1499/1500).
  • Loan mode: min/max auto-correction; amortization correctness; period boundaries.
  • Rates: base vs effective display.
  • Currency switching impacts monthly payment correctly.

answer:
1. Verify UI Elements and Tooltips

Preconditions / Setup:

Open Auto Loan / Quick Auto Loan calculator.

Hover over tooltips for Income / Loan Amount / Currency.

Verify display of Base and Effective interest rates.

Expected Result:

Interest rates are displayed correctly.

2. Validate Monthly Contribution for Income Mode

Preconditions / Setup:

Mode: Based on Income.

Steps:

Enter income = 1499 GEL and 1500 GEL (test threshold).

Check monthly contribution calculation.

Expected Result:

Income < 1500 → contribution = 25% GEL (20% USD/EUR).

Income ≥ 1500 → contribution = 50% GEL (30% USD/EUR).

3. Validate Min / Max Loan Amount in Loan Mode

Preconditions / Setup:

Mode: Based on Loan Amount.

Steps:

Enter loan amount below min → verify auto-correct to min.

Enter loan amount above max → verify auto-correct to max.

Expected Result:

Loan amount auto-corrects to CMS-configured min/max.

4. Verify Monthly Payment Calculation

Preconditions / Setup:

Mode: Based on Loan Amount.

Enter valid loan amount and period.

Steps:

Calculate monthly payment.

Compare with standard amortization formula.

Expected Result:

Monthly payment includes principal + interest.

Calculation matches reference formula.
